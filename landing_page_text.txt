# Substance Abuse Treatment Decision-Making Tool

It can be challenging for healthcare providers to understand and predict which substance abuse treatment protocols will lead to successful outcomes for their patients. This interactive decision-making tool aims to reduce the uncertainty for advisors prescribing treatments, leveraging historical data to provide insights.

It utilizes a machine learning model to predict the probability of successful patient outcomes for a variety of prescribed treatment protocols, based on patient information entered in a web form by the provider. The tool also hosts a dashboard that displays aggregated data of our features, allowing you to explore the historical data used to train the model in a visual and interactive format.

Let's explore what each component of this tool does and how you can it can be used to inform decision-making.

## What does each page do?

1. **Prediction Page**:

On this page, you enter information about the patient of interest. This information will be passed to our machine learning model, which will produce predictions about the likelihood of a successful treatment outcome for the various treatment options, and rank them from highest probability of success to lowest probability of success. This can be used to guide you in recommending the most effective treatment protocol for the patient.

2. **Visualization Page**:

Here, you can interact with our visualization that displays aggregated historical data. The dashboard allows you to explore the historical data in a visual format, with interactive widgets that can be adjusted based on your specific needs or interests. You can choose which features are displayed in the bar chart visualization and manipulate the view by zooming in.

3. **Landing Page (You are here)**:

This page provides an overview of the project, explaining the functionality and purpose of each page, the methodology used in the development of the tool, and how it can be utilized to assist in the treatment of substance abuse.

4. **Model Performance**

This page highlights the performance evaluation of several baseline models, as well as the performance of the final model used for predictions in the web app.

## The Science Behind The Tool

Our machine learning model is built upon historical data from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) provided by SAMHSA, which contains information about the admittance and discharge of individuals who received treatment in substance abuse programs.

To prepare this data for our machine learning model, we performed careful feature selection, preprocessing, and feature engineering. We identified 'successful treatment' as cases where the patient completed the substance abuse treatment and did not need readmission within the same year. This data-driven approach allowed us to use millions of prior cases to determine the most effective treatment methods, considering the unique needs of each patient.

We carefully prevented data leakage, balanced the dataset, and utilized GridsearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the model. As a result, our tool provides more than 80% accuracy score in predicting the success rate of a treatment protocol.

We hope this tool can serve as a useful aid for healthcare providers dealing with substance abuse patients. By combining historical data, machine learning, and interactive visualizations, we've created a platform that can provide important insights, help reduce readmittance rates, and improve the overall success rate of substance abuse treatment programs. Let's work together to combat the substance abuse problem and bring positive change to the lives of millions.
