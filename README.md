# Capstone Team - 7 Substance Use Treatment

## Background & Objectives

Substance use in the United States is a growing problem. In 2021 approximately 22% of the population used illicit drugs and 17% of the population met the DSM-V criteria for having substance use disorder (https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/04/samhsa-announces-national-survey-drug-use-health-results-detailing-mental-illness-substance-use-levels-2021.html).

The objective of this project are to develop a tool for healthcare providers to leverage to determine the best possible substance use treatment for patients.

We will:

1. Design a predictive model using historical substance use admission data
2. Use the predictice to create an easy-to-use dashboard tool

## Datasets

We utilized Treatment Episode Data Set: Discharges (TEDS-D) from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAHMA) Data Archive. The TEDS-D contains records on admissions/discharges of people 12 years and older, and includes demographics information and substance use characteristics. We selected to use the TEDS-D datasets from 2016-2020.

Datasets are publically available here: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/teds-d-2016-ds0001-teds-d-2016-ds0001
