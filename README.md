# Capstone Team - 7 Substance Use Treatment

## Background & Objectives

Substance use in the United States is a growing problem. In 2021 approximately 22% of the population used illicit drugs and 17% of the population met the DSM-V criteria for having substance use disorder [HHS, 2021](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/01/04/samhsa-announces-national-survey-drug-use-health-results-detailing-mental-illness-substance-use-levels-2021.html).

<sub> Note: There is evidence supporting a large drop in admissions during the [COVID-19 Pandemic](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-09-26/big-drop-seen-in-drug-treatment-admissions-during-pandemic#:~:text=Before%202020%2C%20admissions%20to%20treatment,10%2C000%20to%2067%20per%2010%2C000.) <sub> 

Substance use treatment availability and admissions vary across the United States. Generally, more rural areas have less accessability to treatment services and minority groups face more barriers to care than their majority counterparts ([Priester et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695242/)). Additionally, even when they are in treatment, an average of 30% of individuals drop out of substance use treatment ([Lappan et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31454123/)).

Therefore, identifying a treatment program that will help the individual 1) complete the treatment successfully and 2) reduce the possibility of re-admissions would be the ultimate, but challenging goal for providers.

The objective of this project is to develop a tool for healthcare providers to determine the best possible substance use treatment for patients.

We will:

1. Design a predictive model using historical substance use admission data
2. Use the predictice to create an easy-to-use dashboard tool

## Datasets

We utilized Treatment Episode Data Set: Discharges (TEDS-D) from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAHMA) Data Archive. The TEDS-D contains records on admissions/discharges of people 12 years and older, and includes demographics information and substance use characteristics. We selected to use the TEDS-D datasets from 2016-2020.

Datasets are publically available here: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/teds-d-2016-ds0001-teds-d-2016-ds0001
